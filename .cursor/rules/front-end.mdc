- Always build for light and dark theme.
- This is an MVP, do not code overkill solutions.
- You must use Tailwind 4 https://tailwindcss.com
- You must use Supabase as the database and authentication.
- You must use ESLint best practise.
- Do not change the content of the app, this is done by a copywriter.
- You must use shadcn whenever possible to mantain consistency.
- You must use Typescript. Use any as the last resource, in general, try go avoid using any whenever is possible.
- You must follow Components naming convention. Example: nav-bar.tsx
- Accessibility - Proper ARIA labels, focus states, and semantic HTML
- I'll create a rule for myself to avoid the unescaped quotes problem in React/JSX code.
- When writing JSX/React code, always escape quotes in text content to avoid ESLint errors:
Correct Approaches:
1. **Use HTML entities:**
   ```jsx
   <p>&ldquo;{text}&rdquo;</p>  // Left and right double quotes
   <p>&quot;{text}&quot;</p>    // Standard double quotes
   ```
2. **Use single quotes for JSX attributes, double quotes for content:**
   ```jsx
   <p className='text-sm'>"{text}"</p>
   ```
3. **Use template literals with escaped quotes:**
   ```jsx
   <p>{`"${text}"`}</p>
   ```
4. **Use Unicode characters:**
   ```jsx
   <p>{'"'}{text}{'"'}</p>
   ```
Avoid:
```jsx
<p>"Direct quotes in JSX"</p>  // Will cause ESLint error
```
This rule will help me consistently avoid the `react/no-unescaped-entities` ESLint error and maintain clean, compliant JSX code.
